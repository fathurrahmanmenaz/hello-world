Work in a system, for the systems, and tend to solve problems in a structural systems mindset.
I am a third-year Industrial Engineering student at Andalas University who loves to learn new things and try valuable experiences. Here, I have learned the importance of applying classical strategies to modern-day projects.

Being focused on industrial management provide me a broad knowledge of both engineering and economic concepts. I also participated in several projects which invent remarkable products such as mobile app and an educational media.

Passion for innovation, data science, and management systems
